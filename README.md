<br>

* The Vosk speech recogniser is listening permanently, if the listening function is activated. Once it recognises the word "Listen" or "Hey listen", the **Moonshine🌕 ASR** engine will be started each recognised sentence from that point will be treated as a potential command. **Moonshine🌕** is an on-device highly accurate, lightweight, and fast **Speech-To-Text engine**.

### 🧠💬📖⚙️ Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in Eva
____________________________________________________________

Eva utilizes Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in two key ways: speech recognition and contextual command/content extraction. These two components are powered by Vosk and Windows Online Speech Recognition engines for speech recognition, and a custom-built command and content extraction engine that I developed.

1) **Speech Recognition with NLU:**
* Both Vosk and Windows Online Speech Recognition use NLU to convert spoken words from any audio medium into text. These engines are responsible for interpreting and transcribing the user's voice.

3) **Contextual Command & Content Extraction:**
* Eva understands commands and extracts relevant content based on user input. This is done by processing commands through the following steps:

#### The NLU Process in Eva:
1) **Tokenization: Understanding the Command Type:**

* The first step in processing a user command is tokenization. This process breaks down the sentence into individual components to identify the command's action and any additional parameters that need to be extracted.
* Example:
"open chrome" – The first word ("open") signals that the command is to open an application (in this case, "chrome").
"search leopard 1 tank blueprint on google" – The first word ("search") indicates that the action is a web search.
* If the command doesn’t match any known patterns, no action is taken.

2) **Secondary Tokenization: Extracting Parameters:**

* Once the command type (action) is identified, a secondary tokenization occurs to extract any secondary parameters.
* Example:
"search black shoes on amazon" – The system identifies that the content to search for is "black shoes" and the web application is "amazon".
* If the second tokenization fails to identify valid parameters, no action is taken.
 
3) **Third Tokenization: Variable Extraction and Validation:**

* A third round of tokenization is used to extract variables (like search content or website names) based on the previous steps.
* These variables are then validated against a predefined list of valid values (e.g., valid websites or search keywords).
* Once validated, the relevant processes are executed based on the user's command.
If no valid variables are found, no process is triggered.

#### How This Works:
* Tokenization helps Eva break down the input into smaller parts, identifying the core action (open, search, etc.) and the necessary details (content, application, etc.).
* If each step of the tokenization process identifies and validates the necessary components, Eva proceeds to execute the desired action (e.g., opening an app or performing a web search).
* If any tokenization step fails (e.g., if the required content or application is missing), no action is taken.

#### Why This is Important:
* Precision and Accuracy: By using multiple tokenization steps, Eva ensures that the correct processes are executed based on the user's exact intent.
* Flexibility: Eva can handle various types of commands (e.g., opening apps, searching the web) by adjusting to different formats of user input.
* User Experience: This process ensures that even with a wide variety of potential commands, Eva can respond accurately and intuitively.

# ∇🔺📉 Gradient fluctuation formula

<br>

Eva uses a unique algorithm developed by me to create stunning graphical user interface effects. This algorithm controls the gradient fluctuation used to produce smooth, dynamic animations. The effect is achieved by manipulating the gradient value incrementally, creating fluid transitions between different states of the GUI.

## How the Algorithm Works:
The gradient fluctuation formula functions by increasing the offset of the gradient via an incremental sum. This incrementally increases the gradient value until a certain threshold is reached, at which point it decreases the gradient back to its original value, creating a smooth oscillation.

This fluctuation can be represented as two linear functions:

1) Increasing the Gradient (Smooth Animation Start):
When the animation begins, the formula y = x + v is used, where x is the current gradient value, y is the resulting gradient value, and v is the value added to the gradient to increment it. This continues until the threshold for the desired animation effect is reached.

2) Decreasing the Gradient (Smooth Animation End):
After reaching the threshold, the formula y = x - v is applied. The gradient value is decremented by v back to its original value, creating a smooth, flowing animation effect. This ensures that the animation ends as smoothly as it started.

## Formula Breakdown:
* **y = x + v (Increasing the gradient value for a smooth animation start)**
* **y = x - v (Decreasing the gradient value for a smooth animation finish)**

#### Where:
* **x = Current gradient value**
* **y = Resulting gradient value**
* **v = Increment/Decrement value**
* **All values x, y, and v are greater than zero.**
  
This algorithm allows Eva to create smooth, beautiful animations with fluid transitions, adding a polished feel to the application’s graphical interface.

# 📋 Usage

To give commands to Eva, simply say the word "Listen" or "Hey listen". To stop Eva from executing commands say 'Stop listening'.

## Example
_______________
1) Say "Hey listen" or "Listen" to activate Eva.
2) Then say "Search robots are cool on Google" to initiate a web search.
3) Say 'Stop listening' to deactivate Eva.
